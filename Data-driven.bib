	abstract = {This study takes a data-driven approach to deﬁne urban nighttime by examining the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban vitality. Using micro-scale spatiotemporal analysis, this paper empirically provides a comprehensive, yet granular, picture of collective human behaviors in cities. Using Seoul, South Korea as a case study site, it prioritizes the spatiotemporal context in order to mitigate uncertain contextual eﬀects inherent in such forms of data-driven analysis. Instead of leaving the data re-grouping up to researcher’s arbitrary decision, this paper employs a functional principal component analysis ({FPCA}) to systematically transform a set of discrete data to a continuous functional form. This paper applies {FPCA} on 24hour-based dataset of pedestrian traﬃc in Seoul in order to make a data-driven extraction of principal components that characterize the city’s unique patterns of urban vitality. Extracting principal components allows for less statistically obvious phenomena to be measured that would have otherwise been hidden within the data. This approach proved successful in capturing nighttime vitality patterns that are eclipsed by the overwhelming trend of daytime patterns. Additionally, this paper compares diﬀerences between regions and seasons to examine what the diﬀerences can tell about the deﬁnition of nighttime.},

	abstract = {Satellite mapping contributes significantly to ecological studies of landscape composition and structure but needs to better engage local populations in more culturally sensitive assessments of diversity patterns. This study examines how participatory mapping can contribute to land-cover analyses derived from satellite data of landscapes in the Manaslu Conservation Area ({MCA}), Nepal. Landscapes were mapped by local residents, first on paper and again on a geo-registered Landsat Thematic Mapper ({TM}) scene, for April 7, 2010. Local landscape knowledge from men and women was transferred from participatory maps to the classified satellite image to create an integrated landscape map for the {MCA}. Participatory maps added the significance of “place” to the evaluation of landscape diversity (n 5 276 named places for women and 315 for men). The classification of the {TM} image resulted in seven land cover types with only 10\% of the land classified as forests, which are highly fragmented. The final map combined local landscape knowledge (n 5 43 places mapped on the {TM} image and n 5 21 from the transect walks) with the empirical classification of land cover types, increasing the spatial understanding of {MCA} as a “place” of material use and cultural meaning. This integrative map, as process and outcome, promoted collaborative learning about local places and local peoples’ perspectives on their landscape, which can contribute to more adaptive landscape planning and conservation of forest and livelihood resources.},

	abstract = {Geography in a commonsense way is about place. Place is a term used to describe the meaning that humans give to a location. Characterising a location as a place requires a huge amount of time to collect and analyse data. Furthermore, a place deﬁnition associated to a location can become rapidly obsolete. Nowadays, social networks and social media became very popular. People on social networks act like social sensors, reporting information about society, politics, economics, etc. Thus, many researchers have focused on the analysis of posts, combining them together with algorithms or extracting their meaning, keywords or users’ interests. In this paper, I will describe my research project, a visual framework that aims to simplify the process of place deﬁnition using topics generated from the application of Blei et al.’s Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003) on geo-referenced social networks data. My main assumption is that topics allow to capture the sense of place shared by social sensors. The framework will allow users to be not overwhelmed by the large amount of time and data required to understand and deﬁne places.},

	abstract = {How do people come to know the world? How do they get a sense of place and space? Arguably, one of the ways in which they do this is through the practice of remote sensing, among which satellite imagery is one of the most widespread and potent tools of engaging, representing and constructing space. This paper argues that satellite imagery is not only a powerful means of gathering geographical and geopolitical information – for instance through overhead surveillance and the reconnaissance of sites considered suspicious – but is also decisive in producing geographical and geopolitical imaginations. Based on a discussion of the iconic satellite picture of the Korean Peninsula by night, this article shows how satellite imagery constructs – seemingly by itself – North Korea as a distant, foreign and secluded other place in world politics. Referred to in the paper as ‘visual spatial imaginaries’, remote sensing shapes how we imagine places, spaces and sites in what is widely believed to be a terra incognita of the world.},

	abstract = {Space and place are two fundamental concepts in geography. Geographical factors have long been known as drivers of many aspects of people’s social networks. But whether and how space and place affect social networks differently are still unclear. The widespread use of location-aware devices provides a novel source for distinguishing the mechanisms of their impacts on social networks. Using mobile phone data, this paper explores the effects of space and place on social networks. From the perspective of space, we conﬁrm the distance decay effect in social networks, based on a comparison between synthetic social ties generated by a null model and actual social ties derived from real-world data. From the perspective of place, we introduce several measures to evaluate interactions between individuals and inspect the trio relationship including distance, spatio-temporal co-occurrence, and social ties. We found that people’s interaction is a more important factor than spatial proximity, indicating that the spatial factor has a stronger impact on social networks in place compared to that in space. Furthermore, we verify the hypothesis that interactions play an important role in strengthening friendships.},

The volume focused on emerging research linking changes in human populations and land use/land cover to shed light on issues of sustainability, human livelihoods, and conservation, and led to practical innovations in agricultural planning, hazard impact analysis, and drought monitoring. Since then, new research opportunities have emerged thanks to the growing variety of remotely sensed data sources, an increasing array of georeferenced social science data, including data from mobile devices, and access to powerful computation cyberinfrastructure. In this article, we outline the key extensions of the People and Pixels foundation since 1998 and highlight several breakthroughs in research on human–environment interactions. We also identify pressing research problems—disaster, famine, drought, war, poverty, climate change—and explore how interdisciplinary approaches integrating people and pixels are being used to address them.},
